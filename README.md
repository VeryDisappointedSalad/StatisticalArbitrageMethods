# StatisticalArbitrageMethods
Repository for group A for Statistical Arbitrage Methods 2025Z @MIMUW. The subject was to build a trading strategy on semiconductor/ technology sector minute frequency stocks and test, whether ensembling financial data with sentiment analysis from news may improve overall return. The project was divided into several parts.

# Financial data scraping `FinancialDataScraping.ipynb`
This notebook is designed to fetch and compile historical stock data for major microprocessor and semiconductor companies from Polygon.io. It aims to facilitate backtesting and analysis of statistical arbitrage strategies by providing detailed minute-level stock price data for companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and others over a specified period.
# News data scraping

# Parsing data and feature engineering `FeatureEngineering.ipynb`
This notebook takes in the financial and news input and aggregates them into seperate .csv files, each one consisting of `price`, `VADER_score` and `sentiment` in minute frequency.

# Constructing the LSTM model and backtesting `LSTM.ipynb`
This notebook creates two models for each of the `ticker`s available (one BASE, having only financial inputs, and NLP - boosted with `sentiment` and `VADER` score), resulting in overall 20 models and 20 equity curves.

# Ensembling the financial basket and displaying the backtest data `PerformanceMetrics.ipynb`
This notebook generates metrics for strategies mentioned.

# polygon.io
This script leverages the Polygon.io API to retrieve news articles. While it was originally set up with SPY and a predefined list of economic/political keywords, it can be customized to suit different tickers and key phrases. The script was, in fact, used with altered keywords and tickers to fetch related data on the semiconductor/technology sector. It automatically handles query limits by splitting weekly ranges into half-weeks or days, saving the output (including keywords, date ranges, and tickers) to CSV files.

# stocknewsapi1
This script uses the StockNewsAPI to recursively scrape news for a list of tickers. Although the default configuration targets well-known semiconductor stocks (e.g., AMD, NVDA), it can be adapted to any ticker symbols and date ranges required. The code was employed with modified tickers and keywords to obtain similar semiconductor-focused data. Whenever an API call returns the maximum number of articles, the script halves the date range to ensure comprehensive coverage, ultimately storing each itemâ€™s text, sentiment, and ticker information in a CSV file.
